The game Pumpkins and Potions, made for ICS 111, was a solo project in which we had to make a game out of certain specifications, however, we were given freedom to make whatever we wanted past those specifications. I knew that for this project I wanted to make my own assets, and since it was almost Halloween I thought it would be fun to make it around the theme of a witch collecting pumpkins and potions: hence the name "Pumpkins and Potions". The image above is one of my favorite artworks from the project.

The premise of the game is to collect items which boost their corresponding score. As time goes on the scores will decay, and tornados will increase the rate of decay drastically. Tornadoes will also move erradically and teleport items to random locations if touched. If either score reaches 0, then it's game over. The goal is to reach the highest time possible. I also added acceleration based movement, and that acceleration is somewhat preserved when you bounce off of the edges.
