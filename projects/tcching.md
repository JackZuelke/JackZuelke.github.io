I created the poster with the prompt "Inspired in Hawaii", in which we created an essay, poster, or video to attempt to inspire positive change in Hawaii. My poster was meant to display the negative effects of wastewater runoff on sealife, and in particular, coral. I was inspired to make the poster, because I remember my first week in Hawaii there were hoses (like that displayed in the painting) pouring wastewater directly into Waikiki beach, making the water dangerous to swim in, and even causing rashes on people.

The painting was meant to show, not only the corrupted waters, creating dead coral in its wake, but also corruption in the hotels that placed the hoses there without any regard for the ocean, or other people.

It was a lot of fun creating this piece, as I used new techniques to layer watercolor on top of colored pencil; and I liked the chaotic pluming look and contrast of the hand of corruption.
