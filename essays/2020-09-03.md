Never using Javascript before ICS 314 it was nice to learn that my prior Java knowledge would help me learn due to their similarities. freeCodeCamp was also a helpful tool when learning it, although ES6 is still a challenge. Coming off of learning C, and liking the ability to see everything going on, the lack of clarity of data types, functions which can return multiple data types, and most of the shortcuts introduced with ES6, are all quite confusing, particularly the latter as it can be tough to see what's happening. However, given time, experience, and the perspective of it being used for web applications it's at least somewhat understandable why these shortcuts and peculiarities exist: that it could save time and be convenient for smaller web-based applications. Overall though, my first impressions are that it would be far more difficult to read and understand someone else's code; which could defeat the purpose of the shortcuts anyways: to save time.

In ICS 314 we use the concept of athletic software engineering, and do what are called "WOD" (Workout of the day). I believe there are pros and cons to this teaching style. The immediate benefit is getting used to typing Javascript, and by proxy getting used to it's aforementioned peculiarities. It's also good to have a consistent building of knowledge rather than throwing huge projects every once in a while.
