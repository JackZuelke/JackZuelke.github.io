## Expectations For Software Engineering
[//]: # "interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future."
Starting ICS 314, I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of the class, but was excited by the prospect of making fully fledged programs, and what types of skills would be involved that I could learn about. It was somewhat surprising to learn that we would be starting with JavaScript and web-development, but not an unpleasant one. For one, doing something so different from other ICS classes so far should be good learning experience, and a good change of pace. 

## Skills I hope to learn

My main goal for the class is to, as previously mentioned, learn the skills involved in making fully fledged programs, and how to put my programming knowledge to use. Another goal of mine for this semester is to learn how to collaborate on a piece of software at the same time; so I'm excited to learn more about GitHub as well. One of the experiences I hope to be able to learn from is to work on larger, complex projects, and to be effective in modular design, and planning.

## Thoughts on ICS 314, in regards to learning at home

Working from home, the current world situation adds a uniquely difficult challenge to classes, so the question is, how will that affect my learning experience during ICS 314? As technology progresses, working from home is likely to become more prevalent, even after the current world situation passes, especially jobs involving software and technology. Working from home will pose particular challenges, especially when collaborating on projects; however, looking through a positive lens, this challenge can be a good opportinity to learn how to make successful projects working from home. So another unexpected skill, learning to effectively communicate, collaborate, and deliver projects from home, is another goal of mine for this semester.
