## Expectations For Software Engineering
[//]: # "interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future."
Starting ICS 314, I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of the class, but was excited by the prospect of making fully fledged programs, and what types of skills would be involved that I could learn about. It was somewhat surprising to learn that we would be starting with JavaScript and web-development, but not an unpleasant one. For one, doing something so different from other ICS classes so far should be good learning experience, and a good change of pace. 

## Skills I hope to learn

My main goal for the class is to, as previously mentioned, learn the skills involved in making fully fledged programs, and how to put my programming knowledge to use. Another goal of mine for this semester is to learn how to collaborate on a piece of software at the same time; so I'm excited to learn more about GitHub as well.
